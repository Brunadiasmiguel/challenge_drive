# Lyft: Driver's analysis

## Project Description

The goal of the project was to take insignts from three datasets containing information about drivers and their rides to know what is the **driver's lifetime value**. An in depth analysis was performed to answer additional questions related to the topic and python was chosen as a tool to perform the analysis.  

## Questions and Hypotheses

Through the challenge a few questions and hypotheses were raised. The mail goal was to answer the questions: "what is the driver's lifetime value?". 
Additional questions were raised and answered:

1) What factors affect the driver's lifetime value?
2) How is Lyft's revenue calculated?
3) What driver segments generate a higher lifetime value?
4) What is the projected lifetime of a driver?
5) What insights can be taken from the driver's churn information?
6) What weekdays, days or times are more popular?
7) What information can be taken from the Prime Time information in order to incentivise drivers to work at certain times?
8) What relevant business values has the lifetime value?
9) What future strategies can be advised based on the data?

## Datasets 

Three data sets were used for the analysis:

- driver_ids.csv: with the driver ids and onboarding data

- ride_ids.csv: with ride information as distance and time

- ride_timestamps.csv: with the ride timestamp and event information


They were all organised locally in the folder data, not available online due to possible privacy issues.

## Data Wrangling and Analysis

All data manipulation is in the notebook file named data_wrangling.ipynb.

## Results



## Problems

Due to time restraninst

## Repository Organisation

The repository has a git.ignore file, a README.md file with the project explanation and the data_wrangling.ipynb with the data wrangling and analysis, including plotting.
